 - Custom GSC script loading as well as overriding stock scripts
 - Borderless fullscreen
 - FPS unlocked

## Current issues
- Unable to debug much at all, due to the game having heavy anti debug
- "input" module for in-game console breaks mouse input completely
- Some RCE exploits may be present still
- dvarDump command's string formatting is broken, game finds empty dvar and crashes
- Certain localizations have different offsets despite being same game version (only known example so far is russian, read localization and add offset)
- ``Probably more i forgot...``

## Planned and/or started features
- In-Game console
- Re-add prone functionality
- Adding toggle to enable/disable cover, and prone (DVAR)
- Adding toggle for mantling without third person, and make it 1:1 to IW3 (DVAR)
- Adding toggle for climbing without third person, and make it 1:1 to IW3 (DVAR)
- Allow aiming to interrupt sprinting without letting go of any keys. (in other words, make it 1:1 to IW3)
- Force ``r_lodScale`` to ``0`` to prevent pop
- Patch ``com_maxfps``
- Patch overhead font for readability.
- Patch BG_GetPlayerMaxHealth to read DVAR & fix bot movement (Refer to other COD clients of the era)
- Custom Zones via [qos-xport](https://github.com/mjkzy/qos-xport/) & port Xbox/PS3/Wii maps & weapons that QOS PC didn't get.
- Replace scaleform in favor of .menu files for easy cross compatibility with COD assets
- Patch mouse input to get real raw mouse input
- Steam proxy, so it would show you're playing ``Project: Consolation`` on your friend's Steam friendslist.
- Discord RPC
- DW Emulator to allow matchmaking without a legit copy as it is impossible to obtain anymore.
- ``Probably more i forgot...``

## Fun facts
- QoS is abandonware!
- QoS was drastically different on the Wii version and even recieved updates
- QoS seems to be <i><b>very</i></b> similar to the IW3 engine, even though it was developed by [a small team at] Treyarch during <i>World at War</i>
- the game had a very messy development process, and their deadline was 9 months (source: [Treyarch's 007 Quantum of Solace tie-in game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU4FkHVYYdU))
- the developers had to improvise 70% of the plot of the Singleplayer based off their own research into 007
- we could call this "T3", but it's not really a COD game so it wouldn't make much sense and is just a standalone Treyarch title between IW3 & T4
